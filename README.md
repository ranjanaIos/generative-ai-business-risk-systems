# generative-ai-business-risk-systems
Applied generative AI systems using LLMs, RAG pipelines, and AI agents for real-world business use cases.

This repository showcases enterprise-grade Generative AI applications
designed to solve complex business problems.

The project's focus on building practical AI systems using:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Prompt engineering and instruction tuning
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector databases and document indexing
- API-driven and modular system design

The repository includes projects such as operational and financial risk
analysis, telecom customer retention intelligence, automotive sustainability
analytics, security risk management for e-commerce platforms, and a
domain-specific pharmaceutical dictionary chatbot.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate real-world Generative AI
implementation skills, system-level thinking, and the ability to translate
LLM capabilities into scalable business solutions.
